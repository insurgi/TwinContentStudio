### US101 – Script Generator

```gherkin
Feature: AI-assisted script generation

Scenario: User generates a script from a topic prompt
  Given I am logged into my account
  When I select "Generate Script"
  And I enter the topic "What is Web3?"
  Then the system generates a 15-second script in my selected tone
  And I can edit or approve the script
